Exercise: Online Shopping System

AIm of the exercise is to create a simplified online shopping system using inheritance. Consider the following entities:

User: Base class for all users with properties like userId, username, and email.
Customer: Subclass of User with additional properties like address and shoppingCart.
Admin: Subclass of User with additional properties like adminId and adminRole.
Implement the classes with the following details:

User Class:

Properties: userId, username, email
Constructor(s), getters, and setters.

Customer Class (Inherits from User):
Additional Properties: address, shoppingCart
Constructor(s), getters, and setters.

Admin Class (Inherits from User):
Additional Properties: adminId, adminRole
Constructor(s), getters, and setters.

Create a main class to simulate interactions:
Instantiate a few users: a regular user, a customer, and an admin.
Set different properties for each instance.
Display the details of each user, customer, and admin using appropriate methods.
